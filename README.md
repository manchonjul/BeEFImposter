BeEF Imposter
--------------
This is a collaboration I have created between the squid imposter framework and the BeEF Framework in order to create a persistent book for beef that will continue to keep a computer infected on the Beef Botnet C&C after merely visiting the target page.



CREDITS TO WADE ALCORN FOR CREATING THE BeEF framework - I am in no way associated to the creation of that project.
