BeEF Imposter
--------------
This is a collaboration I have created between the squid imposter framework and the BeEF Framework in order to create a persistent book for beef that will continue to keep a computer infected on the Beef Botnet C&C after merely visiting the target page.


To use:
------
1.Clone this repo<br>
2.Install squid using<br>
$apt-get install squid<br>
3.cd into this repo<br>
$cd BeEFImposter<br>
4.Install beef framework<br>
$./install<br>
5.start beef<br>
./beef<br>

MORE COMING SOON STILL -kinda- UNDER DEVELOPMENT PHASE

For More info on the respective frameworks the README.md files will better describe the inner working of both frameowrks used in this project, I have merely done a bit of hacking in order to merge the two frameworks to have it do what I wanted.
